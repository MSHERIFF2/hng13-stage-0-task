‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          # Main HTML file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ style.css          # Stylesheet
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ profile-card.js    # JavaScript for time updates
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ myPhoto.png        # Profile image
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md          # Project documentation
```

## Required Elements

All elements include the specified data-testid attributes:

- Profile card container: `test-profile-card`
- Name: `test-user-name`
- Biography: `test-user-bio`
- Current time: `test-user-time`
- Avatar image: `test-user-avatar`
- Social links: `test-user-social-links`
- Hobbies: `test-user-hobbies`
- Dislikes: `test-user-dislikes`

## Implementation Details

### HTML Structure
- Semantic HTML5 elements (`<article>`, `<header>`, `<main>`, etc.)
- Proper data-testid attributes for testing
- Accessible structure with ARIA attributes
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Clean and organized markup

### CSS Features
- Responsive design using media queries
- Flexbox layout system
- Fluid typography using clamp()
- Custom blue color scheme
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Accessible focus states
- Mobile-first approach

### JavaScript Functionality
- Real-time clock update in milliseconds using `Date.now()`
- Efficient update cycle using `setInterval`
- Clean code structure

## Responsive Breakpoints

The design adapts to different screen sizes with the following breakpoints:
- Small mobile: up to 480px
- Large mobile: 481px - 767px
- Tablet: 768px - 1024px
- Desktop: 1025px - 1440px
- Large Desktop: 1441px and above

## Testing

### Automated Testing Support
All elements include required data-testid attributes for automated testing:
- Profile card: `test-profile-card`
- User name: `test-user-name`
- User bio: `test-user-bio`
- Current time: `test-user-time`
- Avatar: `test-user-avatar`
- Social links: `test-user-social-links`
- Hobbies: `test-user-hobbies`
- Dislikes: `test-user-dislikes`

### Manual Testing Checklist
‚úÖ Responsive layout at all breakpoints
‚úÖ Social links open in new tabs
‚úÖ Keyboard navigation works
‚úÖ Time updates properly
‚úÖ Images load correctly
‚úÖ Hover and focus states work
‚úÖ Content remains readable at all sizes

All data-testid attributes are required exactly as shown so tests are stable.
HTML & semantics

Use semantic tags. Example suggestions:
Wrap the card in <article> (test-profile-card)
Name inside a <header> or an <h2> with aria-label as needed
Bio in a <p>
Avatar inside a <figure> with <img> and <figcaption> (if caption used)
Social links inside a <nav> or <ul>
Hobbies/dislikes each inside <section> and presented as <ul>/<li>
All interactive items (links/buttons) must be keyboard-focusable.
Responsiveness
Card must look good on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
On small screens, stack content vertically; on wider screens, arrange avatar to the left and text to the right (or any clean layout).
Use CSS that doesn‚Äôt break layout when content length changes (word-wrap, truncation with accessible expansion, etc.)
Behavior / Implementation guidance
The time in milliseconds should be accurate and reflect Date.now() at render or on an update tick (if you choose to update it, do so reasonably.
Avatar should accept either a URL or an uploaded image (if upload used, the component must ultimately display an image URL).
Social links should open in a new tab (target="_blank") with rel="noopener noreferrer".
Use semantic markup and modern CSS (Flexbox or Grid).
Acceptance criteria (checklist for grading / automated tests)
All required elements exist and are discoverable by the given data-testids.
HTML uses semantic tags (article, figure, nav, section, headings).
The test-user-time value equals Date.now() (or a value within a reasonable delta if rendering delay exists) and is shown in milliseconds.
Avatar renders with an alt attribute and data-testid="test-user-avatar".
Social links present inside test-user-social-links and optionally individually testable (e.g., test-user-social-twitter).
Hobbies and dislikes are distinct lists with their respective data-testids.
Keyboard navigation works for links; focus styles are visible.
Layout is responsive at typical breakpoints (mobile/tablet/desktop).
